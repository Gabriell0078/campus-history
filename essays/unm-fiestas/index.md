## History of UNM Fiestas


{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="48%" caption=" Poster of UNM Fiestas for the year 2019 hosted and ran by ASUNM [Source](https://news.unm.edu/news/asunms-student-special-events-hosts-fiestas-2019)" src="images/Fiestas-2019.jpg" %}

One of UNMs most known and loved events of the year is Fiestas! Fiestas is now a widely known event not only for the students that attend the university of New Mexico,  but also for everyone in the state. What started as a Three day rodeo event dated back to the 1960s now turned into one of the biggest events in the state. This event now consists of multiple artists and multiple headlines with a vast variety of music taste for everyone to enjoy. 

The way the Fiestas is organized is through sponsorships. This is a key role that is part of the organization that runs this event. We first have to find sponsorships like in past years like KIND and Raising Canes. This and a portion of the ASUNM fee is used to contract the artist too! There is also a Fiestas committee that is also in charge of rule making and any new regulations that might be needed for future events

Some of these important regulations that are new to the event are the use of a clear bag policy, no outside food or water and no digital cameras. These are rules that are updated on a yearly basis and are subject to change but it is always good to know and research these regulations before attending the event to prepare in time.

This event is also now a UNM student only event which is also very important to know as IDs will be checked. In recent events you are able to bring a plus one but always make sure that is available as these are subject to change.

## What to do at Fiestas!
There are so many things that you can do at fiestas, the main one is the concerts which are made of four performers. However there are some things that you can do while you wait for the next show and that is the variety of food that students can go and eat and enjoy some downtime under the shade in the tents. And in the recent times the main sponsor also has a tent with some of their merch that is available to all students

{% include aside.html class="left" text="
I had so much fun! The concert was so good and I love how there are other things available like the food trucks too! I really enjoyed it this year! - UNM Student
" %}

This year at 2025 Fiestas our main sponsor was Raising Canes, and for their booth they had a little scavenger hunt that students could do during the event that if completed they were rewarded with some cool canes merch. But if you're not feeling up to the challenge you can also just relax on the grass and enjoy the view of the event. There are other tents by UNM that offer free water and medical help if needed. 

And at the end of the event every and any student that wants to help with the takedown process of the event can do so and will receive a free event T-shirt. So if you want something to take home as a memory if you stick around to the end there's a chance you can take a fiestas shirt home!






## ASUNM

ASUNM or also referred to as Associated students at the University of New Mexico is a school organization that looks over different branches at UNM and some of these branches do the events here on campus as well as smaller events like movie nights and individual cultural events. ASUNM is made of three branches, of which there are two that are the main organizers for the events year around those are SSE and LoboSpirit. SSE or Student special events does the larger more known events while LoboSpirt does smaller events like Cultural Fairs and so on. However, all under ASUNM which has been doing these events for a long time now and is the fee that students have to pay as part of their tuition if you're wondering what that fee is for! 


## Organizers of Fiestas
The main organizers for Fiestas is SSE as last mentioned this is their area of expertise as they also do special events like Red Rally and big comedy shows. SSE has their own branch under their organization. Under SSE you have the volunteer coordinator, sponsorship coordinator, cultural director, speakers director, assistant director and executive director. All of these roles are filled by students. The way they run the event is through collection sponsorships to fund them and to actually run it they have student volunteers. So if you ever want to help out for some of these events do be on the lookout for future dates where you can register to be part of these events and if you want to take it a push forward the spots of office do change and you can be part of those who get voted if you are looking for a more important role in these events on campus.
