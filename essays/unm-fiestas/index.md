## History of UNM Fiestas


{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="48%" caption=" Poster of UNM Fiestas for the year 2019 hosted and ran by ASUNM [Source](https://news.unm.edu/news/asunms-student-special-events-hosts-fiestas-2019)" src="images/Fiestas-2019.jpg" %}

One of UNMs most known and loved events of the year is Fiestas! Fiestas is now a widely known event not only for the students that attend the university of New Mexico,  but also for everyone in the state. What started as a Three day rodeo event dated back to the 1960s now turned into one of the biggest events in the state. This event now consists of multiple artists and multiple headlines with a vast variety of music taste for everyone to enjoy. [^note1]

[^note1]: "Num bubble at the end of P1" This is my citation at the end of the FIRST paragraph.

Paragragh 2 Aliquam in sapien mauris. Aliquam erat volutpat. Nunc congue ultrices lacus, a efficitur massa pulvinar at. Sed luctus orci sed sem commodo, in rhoncus orci sagittis.

ASUNM or also referred to as Associated students at the University of New Mexico is a school organization that looks over different branches at UNM and some of these branches do the events here on campus as well as smaller events like movie nights and individual cultural events. ASUNM is made of three branches, of which there are two that are the main organizers for the events year around those are SSE and LoboSpirit. SSE or Student special events does the larger more known events while LoboSpirt does smaller events like Cultural Fairs and so on. However, all under ASUNM which has been doing these events for a long time now and is the fee that students have to pay as part of their tuition if you're wondering what that fee is for! 


## Organizers of Fiestas
The main organizers for Fiestas is SSE as last mentioned this is their area of expertise as they also do special events like Red Rally and big comedy shows. SSE has their own branch under their organization. Under SSE you have the volunteer coordinator, sponsorship coordinator, cultural director, speakers director, assistant director and executive director. All of these roles are filled by students. The way they run the event is through collection sponsorships to fund them and to actually run it they have student volunteers. So if you ever want to help out for some of these events do be on the lookout for future dates where you can register to be part of these events and if you want to take it a push forward the spots of office do change and you can be part of those who get voted if you are looking for a more important role in these events on campus.
